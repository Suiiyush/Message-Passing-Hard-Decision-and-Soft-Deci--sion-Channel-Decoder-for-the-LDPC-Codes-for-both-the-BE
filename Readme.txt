This is a Message Passing Hard Decision and Soft Decision Channel Decoder for the LDPC Codes for both the BEC and the BSC.

This project includes the models of the binary erasure channel (BEC) with erasure probability p and the binary symmetric channel (BSC) with bit flip probability p.
The code has been given a total of 3 LDPC codes i.e. three parity check H matrices. It is assumed that an all-zero codeword has been transmitted. The code autimatically converts the patterns of 1's and 0's in the parity check matrix H into a Tanner Graph model. The connections between the bit nodes and the check nodes of this bipartite graph are based on the location of ones in H. The code is generic enough to that is can take any given H matrix not just the three matrices pre-provided.
The model of Tanner Graph performs the message passing from bit node to the variable nodes and vice-versa. Each variable node is connected to a total of dv check nodes and each check node is connected to a total of dc variable nodes. Each check node is an SPC code. It enforces the even parity among all the bit nodes that are connected to it. Thus message passed from variable node to check node is based on the SPC decoding. Similarly, each bit node is essentially a repetition code. It requires that all the messages are the same (0 or 1). Thus the message passed from VN to CN is based on the majority vote decoding of the repetition codes.

We also performed Monte Carlo simulations for each value of p for the BEC and BSC and for each of the three LDPC codes, we perform arounf 10000 simulations.
